        <h1>Who is Andrew Thompson?</h1>
        <p>
        My name is Andrew Thompson, I have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am currently searching for a job in the information technology field, more specifically the UX(user experience) design field. I am looking for a company who does not work their employees to exhaustion. I am looking for a company who expects their employees to work hard and give them the utmost quality, but also supply the resources for an employee to do that. A company who puts the customer first before themselves and tries to make their experience with a product as smooth and enjoyable as possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
        What can I bring to your company? This is an important question and needs to be asked. I have a great work ethic, I have worked three jobs in my life so far, the first one I started in 5th grade working as a groundskeeper for my grandparents construction company, Miller Construction. The second I was a Manager at Taco Bell for approximately 3 years. Currently I am an Electrician at High Country Electric. As demonstrated by my small job pool, I have great loyalty to the companies I work for staying with them for 3 or more years at a time. I also bring an excited and happy personality to the table, one that challenges the norms and brings about intriguing ideas. As a manager at Taco Bell I also learned the skills it takes to be a leader and help guide a team to complete a task we are set to. What drives me everyday to do what I do is that satisfaction from seeing a customer receive a finished product and watching their face light up.

    <div id="hobbies">
        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
        Work is great but not everything that I do, in my free time I have many hobbies I tend to, some indoor activities others outdoor. My outdoor hobbies are biking, hiking, kayaking, and camping. I have enjoyed all of these since i was young and they have taught me a great deal of skills that I apply to my everyday life. At times when I am not found in the great outdoors you can usually find me reading blogs or books, working on Gundam models, or my favorite of all my hobbies woodcrafting. I woodcraft as often as I can, which unfortunately is not as often as I would like as I do not have a workshop. The last hobby on my list is gaming, I enjoy sitting down and playing some video games. They may be simple phone games or giant RPG’s that take hours to complete but it is a passion of mine to complete them to 100% completion.

        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <h4>- Electrician at High Country Electric - [Current]</h4>
            <p>
            As an electrician I have many different jobs on an average workday. During a house rough, where we are doing the initial wire runs, I will help layout the house with my site manager selecting best positions for switches, outlets, and other receptacles. Then we will measure out the rooms to find centers for lights or fans. Once that is done we nail on boxes and then begin to run wire. Once the wire is ran we make up all receptacles and the panel. 
            </p>
            <p>
            During a house finish we install all receptacles, switches, outlets, and phone/TV. We install all lights and then make up the panel adding breakers to it. We then go through and check to make sure all devices are working properly and there are no safety hazards. 
            </p>
            <p>
            During a service change we will take apart the old panel and install a new one with all new breakers and a new panel box. We then install a new pedestal outside and once we are done the electric company comes and hooks up power and we test everything to make sure there are no safety hazards. 
            </p>
        
            <h4>- Taco Bell Shift Manager -</h4>
            <p>
            As a shift manager at Taco Bell I was put in charge of running an 8 to 10 hour shift during the day. This entailed drawing up a plan of the employees that were working that day on where to place them and use each ones strength to the advantage of the restaurant to best meet the company's expectations. I would also do food orders and create schedules at times. I would also be the go to for any customer complaints. I ran a couple interviews for new employees and would do training for new employees as well. 
            </p>
        
            <h4>- Groundskeeper at Miller Construction -</h4>
            <p>
            As a groundskeeper I would travel to the different apartment complexes owned by Miller Construction and do basic groundskeeping. I mowed lawns, pulled weeds, planted plants, and picked up trash.

        <h1>Projects: Technical</h1>
        
        
        <h2>NumberPrime</h2>
        <p>
        NumberPrime is a math education and learning web application. It was created by Michael Scott, Austin Fisk, Grace Johnson, Harsheen Khandpur, Mohana Kona, Donovan Stevenson, Andrew Thompson. Over the course of the semester we worked on NumberPrime creating a web application that would help students, mainly in kindergarten through elementary school learn math. Over the course of the project we learned many things as can be seen below in the slide show presentation link. My own personal major lesson learned was how to work with a large group of people on a single project. Before this project group sizes were relatively small at one or two partners per team. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Since this was a team effort I will only highlight what I specifically worked on myself. The major item I worked on was the login screen and authentication system. We used firebases’ prebuilt authentication framework and tailored it to use only google as an authentication network. We went this route because from Lorri we confirmed madison schools supply all students with a google account. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I was also tasked with competitive landscape where I did research on other products and companies who have already created math learning applications. What I did was I searched the web and app stores for math applications and i did quick trial runs of them trying to figure out what worked and did not work and how we were different from that application.
        </p>
        I also was tasked with the initial wireframing. I met with Lorri for a short interview style meeting to get ideas on what she wanted with this project and created some initial wireframes. I made a critical error at this step of the process. I only interviewed Lorri who was the customer but not a user. I should have also interviewed some of her students to see what types of applications they use, and show them some of the wireframes created so that they could critique it on a usability aspect. We rectified this mistake later on when we showed the application to children and they struggled with how it was designed.
        <p>
        After my initial tasks were complete I began helping with random other tasks here and there, some on the front end, and others on the back end. I have supplied pictures of the items I created and helped others create.
        </p>
       
        <p>
         At the beginning of the project I sat down with Lorri and talked with her on what her ideas were for the project and created some wire frames based off this interview style meeting
        </p>
        
        <h3>Customer</h3>
        <p>
        Lorri Fisk, who works at Lakeview Elementary as a kindergarten teacher brought to a couple of our members, Michael Scott and Austin Fisk, the idea of a new math learning application. Gregory Thompson has also agreed to help supply an open mind to ideas and features; he is a retired teacher who has taught everything from first grade to graduate school. Aside from these customers, we have a target base range of all elementary school teachers who teach kindergarten and first through fifth grade math. After discussions with the customers, we feel confident that our application will fit the needs and requirements they have supplied to us. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Specifically, Lorri help supply field tests as well as fresh, useful ideas and features that we as computer scientists may not conceive on our own. She has agreed to be part of the engineering process throughout the whole semester. Gregory Thompson has agreed to review and help fine-tune the questions to be at appropriate skill levels. With these main customers, we believe we can deliver a fun, interactive, and exciting new way to sharpen your student’s elementary math skills.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
        <p>
        Our application’s main competitors will be other elementary math teaching/review applications. Most applications have nice, whimsical illustrations to keep kids’ attention and try to help them associate the key ideas of math concepts with something familiar to them. Others use plain generic images and a box entry for their methods. Some have videos to teach, and simple quizzes. There are also apps for the phone, iPad, etc., most of which give good visual representation for learning but lack the teaching aspect part. The apps do not supply a “this is how you add/subtract/multiply/divide” type of basic tutorial. We think with our features we have a well-rounded application that will teach, test, and fine-tune a person’s math abilities. Our application will address the issue of combining both fun, appealing graphical elements to keep a child's interest, as well as keeping it simple enough to truly help enhance a user’s skill, which is where most competitors fall short: they either have one or the other, not both. Many competitors also have no form of tracking progress or keeping track of individual records; our application seeks to solve this issue and also allows for teachers to track their students’ progress.
        </p>
        <p>
        Main competitors are listed below along with their main features and some of their pros and cons.
        </p>
        <h4>Mobile applications:</h4>
        <p>

        BYJU’s - The Learning App
        Created by: BYJU’s
        Free on Google Play store. More for middle school level courses; has a fourth and fifth grade app but it is unavailable in the US. The authentication requires you to have a mobile phone and email address, which makes it difficult for children to use. After getting past authentication, navigation is confusing and would require a parent’s or teacher’s assistance. Has amazing tutorial videos and little quizzes for those videos to test knowledge retained. Overall a good competitor, once the elementary math reaches the US.
        </p>
        <p>
        Basic Math
        Created by: Sunsoft Eduware Solutions LLP
        Free on Google Play store. Has a fun, whimsical background and colorful numbers during practice and quizzes. Has no way of tracking progress and no tutorials to explain how to do math concepts. Navigation does not allow you to go back to the main menu. Also has some spelling errors on the menu. The fluidity and the way the quizzes run are extremely easy to understand and brings a nice ease of access to a user. What this app does well is its whimsical nature for children and the fluidity of its math problems. Our application will combine these two features with a nice, navigable UI and allow for progress tracking. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Elementary Math : Grades 1 - 4:
        Created by: Larry Passantino
        Free on Google Play store. This app has a clean navigable UI but does not allow for the user to go back to the main menu after selecting a grade and concept. The concepts are contained in one game repeated over and over, which is guess and check work with no real learning involved. The biggest thing this app does right is the cleanliness of its UI, but its navigation is lacking.
        </p>
        <h4>Web applications will be our main competitors. They are as follows:</h4>
        <p>
        Khan Academy - Early Math:
        https://www.khanacademy.org/math/early-math
        Khan Academy does almost everything perfectly. The one thing that it lacks in is the tutorials, which are mainly videos. If a kid does not like watching a video then they will have trouble grasping a concept. Khan Academy tracks individual progress and it makes use of some whimsical features to put kids at ease when learning about math. Its UI is easily navigable for an older user but might be confusing for a younger one. We want to create an application that does things that Khan Academy does not, like allowing for teachers and parents to see where their students are struggling or excelling. We will also create a UI that is easily navigable for any age range of people. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Buzz Math:
        https://www.buzzmath.com/
        This site has all types of learning tutorials and quizzes, but it is aimed more for a teacher to use as a class tool, like homework or a quiz for class. Our app is targeting supplemental materials, to practice and learn on a student’s own time. Buzz Math is made to be navigable by teachers, but students might have trouble navigating the site. The tutorials and quizzes are done very well, teaching the students core concepts effectively. 
        Most of these competitors are good at giving the quizzes but not so good at teaching material, what our application will do is mix both of these concepts together in a cohesive and fun way. Our application will allow for a user to grow and develop his or her understanding of core math concepts.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Design Details</h3>
        <pre>
            Front-end
        Web Application Components
        HTML5
        CSS3 
        JavaScript
        Bootstrap Template
        The view component of our system, an interactive web application, will be built using HTML5 and CSS3. HTML5 is the current standard for developing web apps and adds additional functionality that will be useful to us, such as new elements that make it easy to integrate graphical content without using third-party plugins. It also supports more elegant forms with different types of inputs and form validation. CSS3 has some added styling effects. For client-side design and requests we will be using JavaScript for dynamic page rendering and for server communication. To make the views look more systematic and professional, we will be using a sample bootstrap template to make our dashboard. 

        Libraries and Frameworks
        JQuery with JQuery UI plugin
        UI Bootstrap
        AngularJS
        JQuery with the JQuery UI plugin is a JavaScript library that we will use for dynamic page widgets, such as accordion lists and drag-and-drop functionality. We decided to use JQuery as opposed to a more powerful alternative library because it is simple and has most of the widgets and functionality that we will use, as well as integrable CSS themes and a library that is customizable to our needs. We wanted to limit our use of libraries and plugins in order to reduce hosting space and overhead for page loading. AngularJS will be used to inject database information into templates.Bootstrap also includes HTML- and CSS-based design templates for many page functionalities like forms, buttons, tables, navigation, and modals.

        Back-end
        Framework
        Firebase is a web-app development platform that offers various services, several of which we will be utilizing for this project. Besides hosting, which will be described below, and back-end persistent storage, which will also be described below, we will be using its built-in authorization service. We chose Firebase because it is backed by Google, is known for easy scalability, and has an excellent array of features built into its easy-to-use dashboard. We chose Firebase because it seems to prevent us from having to “reinvent the wheel,” so to speak, and instead allows us to focus more on the unique aspects of NumberPrime rather than spend hours building authentication services and other minutiae. We do not have large amounts of web development experience between our various group members, so we felt that using a framework like Firebase would strike a good balance in allowing us to produce a viable product while also giving us the freedom to build what we want and opportunity to learn how to develop web apps.
        For the actual coding of the web server, we decided to go with Node.js, a Javascript Runtime Environment that allows for building server-side code with Javascript. This allows for sharing server- and client-side code, removing the necessity of writing the same application logic twice as we would if we utilized some other language like PHP. One drawback to this approach is that if we are not careful it may lead to some blurring of the lines between the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture we are implementing, so we will have to be diligent to insure we organize our project well. While this is a minor drawback, Node.js was also a good idea because using it also involves using Node Package Manager (NPM), which greatly simplifies the process of using external modules for server-side function calls as well as using Firebase with our project.
        Hosting
        Firebase will be our hosting platform. It has pre-built hosting scripts we can add to our project to host from Firebase itself. Firebase also allows us to connect our own custom domain name to the web application, as well as connect cloud functionality. 
        Google Cloud will be our information server. We can connect this to the web application using Firebase as stated above. Google Cloud meets all our needs for data storage and transfer. With Firebase, this will be easy to implement into our web application.
        Database
        We are using the Firebase Realtime database for our backend persistent data storage. As is the nature with all asynchronous programming, when developing a web app it can often be difficult to keep track of whether a local copy of some data from the model reflects its state across all views. Firebase takes care of this with its real-time cloud datastore which keeps data consistent across all instances. This data, incidentally, is stored in a JSON tree data structure, which enables virtually identical schema between front- and back-end object instances, further reducing the amount of overhead needed to keep data consistent across all clients and servers. Additionally, there is a useful GUI built into the Firebase dashboard that easily handles other concerns (e.g. database permissions, backups, tracking usage, etc.), which only further solidified our decision to go with the default storage system that Firebase provides. We decided to go with the Realtime database as opposed to Cloud Firestore (a new database solution Firebase has released) because we feel Realtime has everything we will need, has more documentation, and because Cloud Firestore is still in Beta.
        </pre>
        
        <h3>System Architecture</h3>
        <pre>
        Model-View-Controller
        Model
        Model will be built with Firebase backend, meaning it will update the controller in real time. Essentially the backend is a tree of JSON nodes, which will allow for easy implementation of storing class instances generated by the client-side logic and node backend.
        View
        Web Interface
        The view element of our system consists of a user-facing web interface. Our web interface will be developed according to HTML5 and CSS3 standards. With the basic HTML/CSS view, we will use JavaScript in communication with the controller to include dynamic page content, with JSON as the data interchange format.
        Controller
        When the client makes a request to the user, the controller decides what to do with the input and what to give back to the client, whether it be raw HTML for a page or some JSON data to be parsed on the client side. The controller also handles logic for validating user input and insuring the model is well-protected from damaging behavior, whether it be malicious or unintentional.
